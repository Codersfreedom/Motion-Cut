# Web Development Project 2

## Registration Form Development

### Design Choice: 
My first aim was to make the design modern, so I choose a card view design with an image alongside.  Also I have included a modern navbar which contains all the useful links about the website. 

- For the font-family I choose “Ubuntu”.
- For the body background-color I choose a linear-gradient color.
- For the button color I choose `#573b8a`
- And for the hover color I choose `#6d44b8`

### Features: 
- The main feature of the project is to make a register form with necessary  details and security . 
- There is a navbar which can be useful to navigate through the website.
- There is 4 input fields- username, email, password, confirm password.

### Security:
- All the fields are required to be registered.
- There is a feature where user must provide password minimum of 8 length which must contain a lowercase, a uppercase and a number.
- User can see their password requirement hint below the password input field.
- Also there is a feature to show or hide the password while entering the password.

### Challenges:
- The main challenge which I encountered during this project is to make the website responsive for mobile devices.
- As I used a card with an image alongside , it is suitable for large screen devices. 
- Another challenge was to make the navbar useful in mobile devices.
### Solutions:
- To make the UI responsive in mobile devices, I have used media quires for different widths.
- I make the image div display as none in mobile view, this makes the UI much simpler in mobile devices.
- Also I have used a hamburger icon( using Fontawesome) , which appears in a particular width . 
- User can toggle the hamburger icon to toggle the nav menu.
